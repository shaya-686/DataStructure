glob.glob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, include_hidden=False)
Return a possibly empty list of path names that match pathname, which must be a string containing a path specification.
pathname can be either absolute (like /usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile) or relative (like ../../Tools/*/*.gif),
and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell).
Whether or not the results are sorted depends on the file system. If a file that satisfies conditions is removed
or added during the call of this function, whether a path name for that file will be included is unspecified.

Return a possibly empty list of path names that match pathname, which must be a string containing a path specification. pathname can be either absolute (like /usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile) or relative (like ../../Tools/*/*.gif), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the results are sorted depends on the file system. If a file that satisfies conditions is removed or added during the call of this function, whether a path name for that file will be included is unspecified.

If root_dir is not None, it should be a path-like object specifying the root directory for searching. It has the same effect on glob() as changing the current directory before calling it. If pathname is relative, the result will contain paths relative to root_dir.

This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors with the dir_fd parameter.
